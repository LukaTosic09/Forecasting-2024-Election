# The Coin Flip Effect
# How Swing States Transform Elections Into Games of Chance

## Abstract
This paper uses the poll of polls method to develop a bayesian hierarchical model to forecast the outcome of the 2024 U.S. election. Based on polling data collected from July 21 to October 19, 2024, our analysis indicates that Kamala Harris is the candidate most likely to win the election. Given the complexities of the electoral college voting system and significant political polarization within the U.S, election outcomes appear very close this year. This paper aims to provide deeper insights into voter behaviour.
