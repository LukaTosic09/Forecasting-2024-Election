# Forecasting the 2024 U.S. General Election

## Abstract
This paper forecasts the outcome of the 2024 U.S. general election. Using the
poll of polls approach, a bayesian hierarchical model was developed with data
from FiveThirtyEight using polling data from July 21 to October 19, 2024. The
modelâ€™s prediction is based on the electoral college vote in the seven key swing
states : Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North
Carolina to estimate the overall winner. Results indicate that Harris is predicted
to win with a probaility of 66%.
