# How Swing States Influence The Overall Distribution of Electoral College Seats

## Abstract
This paper employs a Bayesian hierarchical model to forecast the outcome of the 2024 U.S. election. Based on polling data collected from July 21 to October 19, 2024, our analysis indicates that Kamala Harris is the candidate most likely to win with a 66% chance. Given the complexities of the Electoral College voting system and significant political polarization, election outcomes appear very close this year. This paper aims to quantify this closeness and provide insights into voter behavior.
